Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Although these ancient artists rarely signed their work, their talents were highly regarded, as evidenced by the images on the walls of many tombs depicting artists and craftsmen sculpting and polishing statues, producing intricate jewelry, and carving wooden furniture, among other artistic pursuits. The artworks they produced served a range of functions—given as gifts to their gods as acts of worship, placed in tombs to aid the dead in the afterlife, and used in daily life.</p><p>Draftsmen, sculptors, and painters usually worked in teams attached to the royal court or one of Egypt’s many temples.

Albright’s desire to present the minutest subtleties of human flesh or the tiniest elements of a still life often required that he spend years on a single painting.&nbsp;</p><p>A graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Albright established a reputation in the city through early support from the museum, which displayed and purchased many of his paintings.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement. I want to paint pictures with many things, with all the contradictions . . .”</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [200570, 123060, 53652, 53649, 53647, 53644, 53641, 53638, 53635, 53632, 53004, 53001]}, {'title': 'Pablo Picasso', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [229708, 229706, 202392, 200489, 200488, 111479, 111374, 111060, 109260, 84239, 79072, 75315, 66159, 66039, 61612, 58625, 28884, 28067, 20522, 11294, 5357, 5353, 84524, 12867, 4443, 55780, 24217, 128358, 136809, 128359, 68414, 119169, 159038, 198970, 186335, 184873, 180687, 135430, 128356, 128355, 128354, 128353, 128352, 128351, 128350, 128349, 128348, 128347, 128346, 128345, 128344, 128343, 128342, 128341, 128339, 128338, 128337, 128336, 128334, 128333, 128331, 128330, 128329, 128328, 128325, 128324, 128322, 128320, 111373, 105525, 105251, 105250, 105249, 105248, 105247, 105246, 104311, 104308, 100810, 83864, 83862, 83706, 83702, 78566, 61771, 60065, 58605, 45315, 45311, 41433, 40689, 38177, 33324, 31967, 30993, 30988, 29123, 28773, 28769, 28016, 28002, 17924, 6140, 6079, 228089, 227620, 200625, 198971, 198969, 198968, 198967, 195454, 186346, 185729, 182797, 182798, 180686, 159327, 159326, 159325, 159324, 159323, 159322, 159059, 159058, 159057, 159056, 159055, 159054, 159053, 159052, 159051, 159050, 159049, 159048, 159047, 159046, 159045, 159044, 159043, 159042, 159041, 159040, 159039, 159037, 157768, 157767, 157766, 157765, 157764, 157763, 150825, 124770, 124609, 124608, 124607, 124606, 124605, 124604, 124603, 124602, 124601, 124599, 124598, 124597, 124596, 124595, 122457, 122456, 122455, 122454, 122453, 122452, 122451, 122450, 122449, 122448, 122447, 122446, 122394, 111913, 111389, 111096, 111095, 111094, 110718, 109830, 104927, 104307, 104298, 104291, 100811, 96686, 88767, 84522, 84380, 83860, 83858, 83857, 83854, 83852, 83851, 83848, 83846, 83844, 83842, 83840, 83734, 83732, 83730, 83728, 83726, 83724, 83721, 83719, 83717, 83715, 83713, 83711, 83709, 83704, 83649, 82546, 82299, 80086, 79465, 78898, 76068, 76018, 76014, 76012, 76010, 76007, 76006, 75362, 72386, 68138, 64372, 63243, 63239, 63233, 62724, 61867, 61775, 61773, 61770, 61767, 58265, 58204, 55639, 55410, 54806, 45322, 37258, 36965, 36108, 36079, 31978, 31975, 29944, 29121, 24331, 23701, 22667, 22658, 22655, 22652, 22649, 21112, 6143, 5180, 192686, 186339, 159064, 137930, 78842, 74959, 62349, 59767, 18187, 159631, 100815, 100814, 100813, 100812, 54754, 21106, 6157, 61740, 53111, 14839, 13574, 6560, 186395, 186348, 186347, 186343, 186337, 186332, 180689, 180688, 158479, 150826, 150821, 145870, 124769, 117552, 113747, 113746, 113745, 113743, 113741, 113740, 113739, 113738, 113737, 113736, 113735, 113112, 111392, 110992, 107709, 96295, 83821, 82055, 80592, 79377, 75420, 66023, 61864, 51364, 34698, 29909, 28024, 28019, 27955, 20558, 20241, 24205, 109278, 25809, 23968, 109484, 66966, 63246, 18709, 214455, 117694, 109275, 150824, 73647, 56678, 49597, 14636, 28439, 28436, 28433, 28428, 28425, 28421, 28418, 28415, 28411, 202399, 202394, 202389, 104306, 45259, 28631]}, {'title': 'Diteka', 'description': '<p>Active early to mid-20th century<br>Makonde<br>Northern Mozambique or southern Tanzania</p><p>Makonde helmet masks, such as this intricate example, incarnate ancestral spirits who temporarily return among their living descendants on earth.

The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290]}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233]}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement. I want to paint pictures with many things, with all the contradictions . . .”</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [200570, 123060, 53652, 53649, 53647, 53644, 53641, 53638, 53635, 53632, 53004, 53001], 'n_artworks': 12}, {'title': 'Pablo Picasso', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [229708, 229706, 202392, 200489, 200488, 111479, 111374, 111060, 109260, 84239, 79072, 75315, 66159, 66039, 61612, 58625, 28884, 28067, 20522, 11294, 5357, 5353, 84524, 12867, 4443, 55780, 24217, 128358, 136809, 128359, 68414, 119169, 159038, 198970, 186335, 184873, 180687, 135430, 128356, 128355, 128354, 128353, 128352, 128351, 128350, 128349, 128348, 128347, 128346, 128345, 128344, 128343, 128342, 128341, 128339, 128338, 128337, 128336, 128334, 128333, 128331, 128330, 128329, 128328, 128325, 128324, 128322, 128320, 111373, 105525, 105251, 105250, 105249, 105248, 105247, 105246, 104311, 104308, 100810, 83864, 83862, 83706, 83702, 78566, 61771, 60065, 58605, 45315, 45311, 41433, 40689, 38177, 33324, 31967, 30993, 30988, 29123, 28773, 28769, 28016, 28002, 17924, 6140, 6079, 228089, 227620, 200625, 198971, 198969, 198968, 198967, 195454, 186346, 185729, 182797, 182798, 180686, 159327, 159326, 159325, 159324, 159323, 159322, 159059, 159058, 159057, 159056, 159055, 159054, 159053, 159052, 159051, 159050, 159049, 159048, 159047, 159046, 159045, 159044, 159043, 159042, 159041, 159040, 159039, 159037, 157768, 157767, 157766, 157765, 157764, 157763, 150825, 124770, 124609, 124608, 124607, 124606, 124605, 124604, 124603, 124602, 124601, 124599, 124598, 124597, 124596, 124595, 122457, 122456, 122455, 122454, 122453, 122452, 122451, 122450, 122449, 122448, 122447, 122446, 122394, 111913, 111389, 111096, 111095, 111094, 110718, 109830, 104927, 104307, 104298, 104291, 100811, 96686, 88767, 84522, 84380, 83860, 83858, 83857, 83854, 83852, 83851, 83848, 83846, 83844, 83842, 83840, 83734, 83732, 83730, 83728, 83726, 83724, 83721, 83719, 83717, 83715, 83713, 83711, 83709, 83704, 83649, 82546, 82299, 80086, 79465, 78898, 76068, 76018, 76014, 76012, 76010, 76007, 76006, 75362, 72386, 68138, 64372, 63243, 63239, 63233, 62724, 61867, 61775, 61773, 61770, 61767, 58265, 58204, 55639, 55410, 54806, 45322, 37258, 36965, 36108, 36079, 31978, 31975, 29944, 29121, 24331, 23701, 22667, 22658, 22655, 22652, 22649, 21112, 6143, 5180, 192686, 186339, 159064, 137930, 78842, 74959, 62349, 59767, 18187, 159631, 100815, 100814, 100813, 100812, 54754, 21106, 6157, 61740, 53111, 14839, 13574, 6560, 186395, 186348, 186347, 186343, 186337, 186332, 180689, 180688, 158479, 150826, 150821, 145870, 124769, 117552, 113747, 113746, 113745, 113743, 113741, 113740, 113739, 113738, 113737, 113736, 113735, 113112, 111392, 110992, 107709, 96295, 83821, 82055, 80592, 79377, 75420, 66023, 61864, 51364, 34698, 29909, 28024, 28019, 27955, 20558, 20241, 24205, 109278, 25809, 23968, 109484, 66966, 63246, 18709, 214455, 117694, 109275, 150824, 73647, 56678, 49597, 14636, 28439, 28436, 28433, 28428, 28425, 28421, 28418, 28415, 28411, 202399, 202394, 202389, 104306, 45259, 28631], 'n_artworks': 369}, {'title': 'Diteka', 'description': '<p>Active early to mid-20th century<br>Makonde<br>Northern Mozambique or southern Tanzania</p><p>Makonde helmet masks, such as this intricate example, incarnate ancestral spirits who temporarily return among their living descendants on earth.

Warhol', 'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

Warhol', 'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058]}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

Warhol', 'description': '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058]}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination.

An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177]}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism.

In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs.

Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement.

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture.

Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life.

As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [126858, 65290], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Pieter Bruegel, the elder', 'description': None, 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [109142, 25374, 15233], 'n_artworks': 3}, {'title': 'Grant Wood', 'description': '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930).

closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358\" target=\"_blank\">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href=\"https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359\" target=\"_blank\">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [226725, 227646, 194374, 194373, 194372, 194371, 194370, 194369, 194368, 194367, 194366, 194365, 194364, 194363, 194362, 194361, 194360, 194359, 194358, 194357, 194356, 194355, 194354, 194353, 194352, 194351, 194350, 194349, 194348, 194347, 194346, 194345, 194343, 194342, 194341, 194340, 194339, 194338, 194337, 194336, 194333, 194335, 194334, 194332, 194331, 194330, 194329, 194328, 194327, 194326, 194325, 194324, 194323, 194322, 194321, 194320, 194319, 194318, 194317, 194316, 194315, 194314, 194313, 194312, 194311, 194310, 194309, 194308, 194307, 194306, 194305, 194304, 194303, 194302, 194301, 194300, 194299, 194298, 194297, 194296, 194295, 194294, 194293, 194292, 194291, 194290, 194289, 194288, 194287, 194286, 194285, 194284, 194283, 194282, 194280, 194278, 194277, 194276, 194275, 194274, 194273, 194272, 194271, 194270, 194269, 194268, 194267, 194266, 194265, 194264, 194262, 194263, 194261, 194260, 194259, 194258, 194257, 194256, 194255, 194254, 194253, 194252, 194251, 194250, 194249, 194248, 194247, 194246, 194245, 194244, 194243, 194242, 194241, 194240, 194239, 194238, 194237, 194236, 194235, 194234, 194232, 194233, 194229, 194230, 194231, 194228, 194226, 194227, 194225, 194221, 194220, 181192, 181191, 181190, 181189, 181188, 181187, 181186, 181185, 181184, 181165, 181164, 181163, 181162, 181161, 181160, 181159, 181158, 181157, 151214, 149980, 149060, 149059, 149057, 149056, 125658, 121247, 121246, 121159, 97444, 93882, 76282, 73486, 69013, 66759, 66756, 66442, 66439, 47149, 25699, 194279, 230609, 229406, 229362, 229361, 229360, 229359, 229358, 229357, 229356, 229355, 249539, 194281, 150052, 150051, 150050, 150049, 150048, 150047, 150046, 150045, 150044, 149983, 194224, 149058], 'n_artworks': 215}, {'title': 'Noda Tetsuya', 'description': '<p>Noda Tetsuya is one of the most successful contemporary print artists in the world.

artistic styles. Scholars often name these artists after the museums or institutions that own their works, or the place where their work was first identified.&nbsp;</p><p>This identification system was developed in the early 20th century by Sir John Beazley (1885–1970), a British art historian, classical archaeologist, and international authority on Greek art. Using his exceptional talent and sharp eye to focus on small stylistic details that distinguished the hand of one painter from that of another, Beazley was able to identify&nbsp; “signatures” or particular motifs used by specific artists. An artist might be recognized by something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. <br><br>The Chicago Painter was one such ancient Greek painter identified by Beazley, who first attributed Greek vases to the artist in his 1918 publication <em>Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums.</em> The painter was originally called the \"Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the \"Chicago Painter.\" The name comes from a large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first and finest example of this artist\\'s work to be identified. While we do not know much about the artist, he was likely male and a capable draftsman, active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC. He was a follower or student of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vessel in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome) and had a preference for depicting graceful and tender scenes where figures are focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that he decorated, depicts scenes related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, highlighting his uncluttered, elegant signature style.</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [215100, 177], 'n_artworks': 2}, {'title': 'Claude Monet', 'description': '<p>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the French artistic movement known as Impressionism. Throughout his long career, Monet portrayed the people closest to him and the places he knew best. He favored family and friends as models, often working and exhibiting alongside fellow artists. In the early years he painted the forests of Fountainbleau, Parisian boulevards, suburban villages along the Seine, seaside towns, and flowering fields, and later, after buying a house at Giverny northwest of Paris, stacks of wheat and water lilies.&nbsp;Monet was a proponent of <em>plein air </em>painting, working directly out-of-doors on compositions he would later revise and sometimes complete in his studio. He painted his beloved water lilies in Giverny, where he tended to a water garden and a small pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. Another favorite subject, <em>meules</em> (stacks of wheat sometimes referred to as “haystacks”), were for Monet a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival—constructed by humans but created by nature.</p><p>While Monet’s series paintings appear compositionally simple, the artist adapted his palette and brushwork to each temporal situation, conveying the complexity of color, light, and texture on each canvas.&nbsp;As he described, “One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all.” Only by working in series could Monet truly render, as he put it, “what I experience”—in other words, how he perceived and responded to these subjects, which were defined by light and air as time passed and the seasons changed.</p><p>The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s stacks of wheat in the world.

At other times, the artists are named after subjects or scenes that they created, as is the case with the Euaion Painter. His name derives from an inscription on another vase in the Musée du Louvre that identifies a handsome boy as Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, one of the great playwrights of ancient Athens. He was a popular subject in Greek vase painting as a number of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/87669/lekythos-oil-jar\" target=\"_blank\">other artists also identify him </a>with inscriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Euaion Painter was an ancient Greek artist active in Athens between 460 and 440 BCE. He decorated vases using the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65202/hydria-water-jar\" target=\"_blank\">red-figure</a> technique, which was invented about 525 BCE. The Euaion Painter’s style tells us he was a student of another ancient Greek vase painter whose name we do know, Douris. Douris’s name is known because he signed 38 vases as painter, one as potter, and one as both. We can identify the work of the Euaion Painter by the&nbsp; tall, small-headed, thin and rarely overlapping figures that populate his designs. He specialized in decorating cups but also decorated other small vessels, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/615/pyxis-container-for-personal-objects\" target=\"_blank\">pyxides</a> (sing. pyxis), which were used to hold personal objects.&nbsp;</p>', 'agent_type_title': 'Individual', 'agent_type_id': 7, 'artwork_ids': [615], 'n_artworks': 1}]\n"
